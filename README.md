## Tutorial: Branching & CI Pipelines in GitHub
### Introduction

When working in a team, everyone contributes code simultaneously. If all developers directly push changes to the main branch, it can quickly become chaotic.

- Branches allow developers to work on features or fixes independently before merging them back into main.

- CI pipelines (Continuous Integration) automatically build and test your code whenever changes are pushed, ensuring nothing breaks before merging.
